Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. 

The Scrum framework consist of:

1. Scrum Teams and their associated roles,

2. Events, 

3. Artifacts, and 

4. Rules.

Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrumâ€™s success and usage. The rules of scrum bind everything together, governing the relationships and interaction between them.
