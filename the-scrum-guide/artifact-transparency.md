# Artifact Transparency
Scrum relies on transparency. Decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artifacts. To the extent that transparency is complete, these decisions have a sound basis.

The Scrum Masterâ€™s job is to work with the Scrum Team (Product Owner, Development Team) and the organization (or any other involved parties) to increase transparency of the artifacts. 

## Definition of "Done"
When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as "Done", everyone must understand what "Done" means. The definition of "Done" is used for:

* Ensure transparency,

* Assess when work is complete on the the Product Increment, and

* Guide the Development Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items it can select during a Sprint Planning.

As Scrum Teams mature, it is expected that their definitions of "Done" will expand to include more stringent criteria for higher quality.

If a definition of "done" is included in the development guidelines of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as minimum. In any other case:

* The Development Team must define a definition of "done" appropriate for the product, and

* If multiple Scrum Teams are working on the system or product, the teams have to agree on the "Done" definition.
