# The Scrum Team
The Scrum Team consists of:

1. A Product Owner,

2. A Development Team, and

3. A Scrum Master.

Scrum Teams are:

1. Self-organizing: choose how best to accomplish their work—rather than being directed by others outside the team—, and

2. Cross-functional: teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.

The Scrum teams are organized to:

* Optimize flexibility,

* Optimize creativity, 

* Optimize productivity, and

* Deliver iteratively and incrementally.

**Iterative/Incremental "Done" deliveries ensure that a potentially useful version of the product is always available**.

## The Product Owner
The Product Owner is responsible for:

1. Maximizing value of the product,

2. Maximizing work of the Development Team,

3. Solo-managing the Product Backlog.

Product Backlog management includes:

1. Clearly expressing Product Backlog items,

2. Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions, showing what the Scrum Team will work on next, and

3. Ensure that the Product Backlog is visible and transparent, ensuring that the Development Team understands the items to the level needed.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee^[The guide says something confusing at this point: _"The Product Owner may do the above work, or have the Development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable."_]. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, **but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner**.

**For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions**. The product Owner’s decisions are visible in the **content** and **ordering** of the Product Backlog. 

No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.

## The Development Team
The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a reasonable "Increment of Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the "Increment".

To optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the "Increment of Done", Development Teams have the following characteristics: 

1. They are self-organizing. No one (_not even the Scrum Master_) tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into "Increments" of **potentially releasable functionality**,

2. They are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product "Increment",

3. Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer,

4. Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team^[_"Regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis."_],

5. Developers may have specialized skills, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

### Development Team Size
Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain agile, and large enough to complete significant work with a Sprint. The following applies:

* Fewer than three (3) _Developers_ decrease interaction and productivity (skills constraints cause the Development Team to deliver a potentially releasable Increment), and

* More than nine members (9) requires too much coordination and complexity for an **empirical process**.

The Product Owner and Scrum Master roles are not included in this count unless they are also executing the work of the Sprint Backlog. 

## The Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team, and is responsible for:

* Ensuring that the Scrum is understood and enacted,

* Ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules,

* Helping those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions are good for the process, which are not—and provide the support to change them.

### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner directly by:

1. Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value,

2. Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner indirectly by:

1. Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management,

2. Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for a clear and concise Product Backlog items,

3. Understanding product planning in an **empirical environment**, and

4. Understanding and practicing agility.

### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:

1. Coaching the Development Team in self-organization,  cross-functionality, and in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood, 

2. Helping the Development Team to create high-value products, and

3. Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress. 

### Scrum Master Service to the Organization
The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

1. Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption, 

2. Planning Scrum implementation within the organization,

3. Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and **empirical product** development,

4. Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team, and

5. Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.
