# Scrum Events
Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are **time-boxed** events, such that every event has a maximum duration. 

For example, when a Sprint begins, it cannot be shortened or lengthened. 

Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something, and are designed to enable:

1. Critical transparency, and

2. Inspection.

Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost of opportunity to inspect and adapt. Opposite to Sprints, these events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved. 

## The Sprint
The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, _"a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created."_ Sprints: 

* Best have consistent duration in a throughout a project, and 

* Start immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of:

1. The Sprint Planning,

2. Daily Scrums, 

3. The development work,

4. The Sprint Review, and

5. The Sprint Retrospective.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made to the Sprint Goal,

* Quality goals do not decrease, and

* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

**Each Sprint may be considered a project**—with no more than one-month horizon—defining clearly:

* What is to be build, 

* A flexible plan defining the work, and

* Resultant product.

As Sprints are limited to one calendar month:

* Complexity, 

* Risk, and 

* Costs 

are bounded, because inspection and adaption events happen at least every calendar month.

### Cancelling a Sprint
A Sprint can be cancelled before the time-box is over when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete—due to:

* Company (stakeholders) change direction,

* Market or technology conditions change, or

* Development Team or Scrum Master show reasons for that.

Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint. 

When a Sprint is cancelled, any completed an "Done" Product Backlog items are reviewed. However, these actions are usually happening:

1. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it, and

2. The remaining parts of the Sprint are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog^[Here I am asking myself: _"Why if the work was already obsolete?"_].

Due to the short duration of Sprints, and because they are traumatic and resource consuming—everyone has to regroup in another Sprint Planning—, cancellation rarely makes sense and is very uncommon.

## Sprint Planning
The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team, and answers the following:

1. What can be delivered in the Increment resulting form the upcoming Sprint? or _What can be done this Sprint? The Sprint Goal_, and

2. How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved? or _How will the chosen work get done? The Sprint Backlog_

The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place, and the attendants understand its purpose. 

The Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. 

Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. 

By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

### What can be done this Sprint? The Sprint Goal
The Product Owner discusses with the Development Team the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the **Sprint Goal**.

The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint, and the Development Team works to forecast the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. 

The **input to this meeting** is:

1. The Product Backlog,

2. The latest product Increment, 

3. Projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint, and

4. Past performance of the Development Team.

The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team, which is the only one who can asses what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint. 

The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner. 

After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal, which provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. 



### How will the chosen work get done? The Sprint Backlog
Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides **how** it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. 

The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called **Sprint Backlog**. 

The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during the Sprint Planning and as needed during the Sprint.

The Development Team usually starts by designing the system and the work needed to convert the Product Backlog into a working product Increment. 

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate **the scope of Sprint Backlog** within the Sprint^[_A Sprint Backlog sounds like a Shape Up Pitch. In that case, the Pitch would focus more on the goal of the work, rather than in the Product Backlog items._].

## Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. During the meeting, the Development Team members explain:

1. What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

2. What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

3. Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

The Daily Scrum: 

* Is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity,

* Optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal, 

* Encourages the Development Team to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.

The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussion, or to adapt or replan the rest of the Sprint’s work.

The Scrum Master serves the Daily Scrum by:

* Ensuring that the Development Team has the meeting, 

* Ensuring that the Development Team conducts the meeting,

* Teaching the Development Team to keep the 15-minute time-box, and

* Enforcing that only Development Team members participate on it.

## Sprint Review
A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum and stakeholders (invited by the Product Owner) collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. The result is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.

Sprint Review is a four-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. This is an informal meeting to elicit feedback and foster collaboration, and includes the following elements:

1. The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done", and

2. The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands, and if needed ptojects likely completion dates based on progress to date,

3. The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems were found, and how they solved them, and

4. The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment, and

5. The entire group review how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed, i.e. timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.

## Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. The Sprint Retrospective includes the following actions:

* Inspect last Sprint in terms of people, relationships, process, and tools, 

* Identify the items that wen well and potential improvements, and

* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work to increase product quality by adapting definition of "Done".

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the Next Sprint Planning. This is a three-hour time-boxed meeting for one-month Sprints. 

The Scrum Master participates as a peer team member in the meeting from the accountability over the Scrum process.
