# Scrum Theory
On one hand, Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach in order to:

* Optimize predictability, and

* Control risk.

On the other, Scrum is founded on empirical process, which is uphold by three pillars:

1. Transparency,

2. Inspection, and

3. Adaption.

## Transparency
Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. At least they need to share a minimum understanding in:

* Common language to use all along the process, and

* Definition of "Done".

## Inspection
Scrum users should inspect Scrum artifacts and progress to detect undesirable variances towards a Sprint goal. 

However, usersâ€™s inspections should not be so frequent (so they get in the way of the work); instead, sometimes would be beneficial to have dedicated inspectors.

## Adaption
If an inspector determines that the goal deviation is outside acceptable limits, an adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

## Inspection and Adaption
Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaption (as described in the *Scrum Events* section):

1. Sprint planning,

2. Daily Scrum,

3. Sprint Review, and

4. Sprint Retrospective.
