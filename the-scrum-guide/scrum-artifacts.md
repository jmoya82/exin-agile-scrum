# Scrum Artifacts
Scrum Artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaption.

## Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. _Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product, but the Product Backlog is unique._

The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering.

A Product Backlog is never complete. The earliest development of it only lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. _This would be the case after a initial development assessment for a product—when a forecast of all the potential features take place_.

The Product Backlog:

* Exists as long as the product exists,

* Evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves,

* Is dynamic (requirements never stop changing to identify what is appropriate for the product), competitive, and useful,

* Lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes potential changes to be made to the product in future releases, and

* Becomes larger and exhaustive as the product is used and the marketplace provides feedback.

## Product Backlog Refinement
Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. 

This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the *details* and *estimates* of the Product Backlog items. 

The Development Team is responsible for all estimates. The Product Owner may influence the Development Team by helping it understand and select trade-offs, but the people who will perform the work make the final estimate.

The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done (but it should not take more than 10% of the Development Team capacity). 

However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion. 

Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually more refined, i.e. clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. Product Backlog items that will occupy the Development Team for the upcoming Sprint are refined so that any one item can reasonably be "Done" within the Sprint time-box, and deemed "Ready". _From a Shape Up perspective, higher Product Backlog items are pitches_.

### Monitoring Progress Toward a Goal
At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed. The Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review, and compares it with the work remaining at previous Sprint Reviews to asses progress towards the goal. This information is made transparent to all stakeholders. 

## Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team, and has the following purpose:

* Define what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality into a "Done" Increment,

* Make visible all the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal, and

* Define a plan with enough detail.

The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint. _This means that the Sprint Backlog is dynamic_: the Development Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint, and the Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint. This emergence belongs solely to the Development Team, and only the Development Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. These are typical Development Team actions happening during a Sprint:

* As new work is required, the Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog,

* As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated, or

* When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed.

All these changes can be understood in the Daily Scrum.

### Monitoring Sprint Progress
At any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The Development Team tracks this total work remaining at leas for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal.

### Increment
The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done", which means it must be in usable condition—regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it or not—and meet the Scrum Team’s definition of "Done".
